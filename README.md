## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# if you can't run the project with those dependencies, it might be a problem with webpack and sass loader latest versions. Try to delete node_modules, package-lock.json an run :
$ npm i --legacy-peer-deps
# More informations : 
# https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js/issues/8277
# https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/530

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
